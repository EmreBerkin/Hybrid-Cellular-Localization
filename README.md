# Hybrid-Cellular-Localization
A high-precision hybrid localization system that integrates Machine Learning (ML) models with a Hybrid Particle Filter (PF) and Hybrid Unscented Kalman Filter(UKF) to track user movement using cellular signal metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, and SINR). This project demonstrates the fusion of statistical filtering and predictive modeling for robust outdoor positioning.

### Abstract
Traditional GPS-based positioning systems can experience problems in enclosed spaces, tunnels, or dense urban environments due to signal interruptions, path loss, and environmental factors. Furthermore, GPS systems are not energy efficient and consume a lot of energy. This study aims to achieve location estimation with high accuracy and lower energy consumption, even in environments without GPS access, using the existing GSM infrastructure.
